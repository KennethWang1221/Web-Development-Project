<center><h1>Western media ranks Spain with six weaknesses: invalid possession, 26 shots and only 1 penalty</h1><br/>
<p>Source: Netease Sports</p></center><br/>
<p>
Spain, which used to be the invincible player in the world, now lost to the Netherlands and Chile in succession? "Aspen" lists six reasons. According to the newspaper, Spain has a high ball possession rate, but they are all invalid, and Spain's scoring efficiency in front of the opponent's goal is too low.</p><p>

1. Passing errors</p><p>

In the first two games, Spain had a total of 194 pass errors. In the same period of the World Cup in South Africa, this data was 167 times. Too many passing errors have disrupted Spain's overall attacking rhythm. Although Harvey was taken in the second game, he only missed 2 passes in 84 passes in the first game. He is still the player with the highest passing accuracy.</p><p>

2. Invalid possession of the ball</p><p>

In both games, Spain has an absolute advantage in possession, with ball possession rates of 62% and 65% respectively. In terms of real ball time, Spain has 30 minutes more possession than opponents. However, Spain's possession of the ball is invalid and does not damage the opponent's defense.</p><p>

3. Defensive black hole</p><p>

In two games, Spain lost 7 goals. In the World Cup in South Africa, Spain conceded only 2 goals in 7 games. Even if Bosque took down Pique, Harvey Martinez still didn't play as good as it should be.</p><p>

4. The opponent's efficiency is extremely high</p><p>

In the two games, Spain was shot 21 times and the opponent averaged 10.5 shots per game, which is not much different from the 9 times in the World Cup in South Africa and 8 times in the 2012 European Cup. However, the opponents scored much more efficiently. The Netherlands scored 5 goals in 13 shots, and Chile also scored 2 goals in 8 shots.</p><p>

5. Its own efficiency is extremely low</p><p>

The opponent's attack efficiency is extremely high, and Spain's efficiency is very low. In the first two games, Spain shot a total of 26 times, but only scored a penalty. In positional warfare and set-ball offense, Spain did not make any money at all.</p><p>

6. Busquets is too soft</p><p>

Bosque replaced Harvey Alonso in two consecutive games in advance, and Busquets often had to take the responsibility of midfield defense alone. But in these 180 minutes, Busquets had 0 fouls. Busquets' defense is not tough enough, which allows opponents to quickly pass the Spanish midfield and directly kill the defense.</p>
