<center><h1>England "lives up to expectations" is on the verge of being out, the weak defense drags down the Three Lions</h1><br/>

The 23-man roster announced by Hodgson has also caused some controversy. Ashley Cole, the defensive deity, was abandoned, and Huo was unwilling to call Terry again, which is also regrettable. Due to Manchester United's poor performance last season, creative midfielders such as Carrick and Cleverly were also abandoned. Hodgson focused on cultivating newcomers, but his Three Lions Corps appeared to be too immature, and public opinion was controversial. In the last warm-up match before the World Cup, England was sullied 0-0 by the underdogs Honduras. Hodgson's conservative style of play caused widespread dissatisfaction.</p><p>

In this World Cup, England set out low-key with the doubts of the Chinese. In the first group match, the Three Lions "unsurprisingly" lost to Italy 1-2. However, England's sharp offensive football still won a lot of applause. Especially the young player Sterling, who entered the World Series for the first time, he is not afraid of tigers when he is born with a calf, he is not stage fright in the face of his opponents, and he dares to break through and dash. England's offense has won praise, but their defense is still a big problem.</p><p>

When it comes to defense, both the fans and the media have always been worried. Since Terry retired from the England team, the Three Lions missed the iron guard all the time. Last season, Mourinho reused Terry after returning to Chelsea. Terry performed well and once again demonstrated the style of a world-class defender. There are calls for Hodgson to re-call Terry, but Terry did not want to embarrass the FA. He decisively chose to look forward and ruled out the possibility of re-calling Terry.</p><p>

It turns out that England needs Terry. In this World Cup, the center-back combination of Jagilka and Cahill is similar to a "sleepwalking" on the field, and has been criticized for its performance, whether it is in marking or in defense. Obviously, the England team's defensive line is obviously unreceived. New generations like Phil Jones and Smalling have stagnated in recent years. In this context, the Three Lions also needed defense leaders like Terry to build the Great Wall of Steel.</p><p>

But unfortunately, the Football Association insisted on going its own way and forced Terry to withdraw from the national team. It now appears that the FA has paid a heavy price for this, and England is likely to be out of the World Cup group stage for the first time since the 1958 World Cup. It now appears that there is no shortage of offensive players in England. Young people such as Sterling, Henderson, Barkley and Wilshere have a bright future. Only on the defensive end, England lacks good defensive seedlings. It can be said that England's midfielder has a future, but in terms of defense, the Three Lions temporarily let us not see the future.
